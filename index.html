        <h2>About Felix</h2>
        <p>Felix the Cat is a funny-animal cartoon character created in the silent film era. The anthropomorphic black cat with his
        black body, white eyes, and giant grin, coupled with the surrealism of the situations in which his cartoons place him,
        combine to make Felix one of the most recognized cartoon characters in film history. Felix was the first character from
        animation to attain a level of popularity sufficient to draw movie audiences.</p>
